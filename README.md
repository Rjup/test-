# karate-mini-mocks
A minimal example using [Karate Test Doubles](https://github.com/intuit/karate/tree/master/karate-netty) to mock and test HTTP services

The [server.feature](src/test/java/server/server.feature) is Karate Test Doubles code that simulates an HTTP server.

The [client.feature](src/test/java/client/client.feature) tests it using the very readable Karate syntax.

The rest is glue, and there's not much of it!
